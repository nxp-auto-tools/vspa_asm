After generating the files from ADL, there are some manual changes to be performed.

Changes to be performed:

1) Copy the assembler ADL generated files to the "assembler" folder:
	- VSPA1:
		"as-vcpu_spec.cc" => "as-vcpu1_spec.cc";
		"as-ippu_spec.cc" => "as-ippu1_spec.cc";
	- VSPA2:
		"as-vcpu_spec.cc" => "as-vcpu2_spec.cc";
		"as-ippu_spec.cc" => "as-ippu2_spec.cc".
2) Run the "transform.pl" script from within the "enterprise_vspa_asm" directory.

The VSPA1/2 assembler requires at least GCC 4.9.1 and the support for C++11 should be enabled.
In order to build the assembler executable you have to run:
	- VSPA1:
		make all CPP_COMPILER="g++ --std=c++11" C_COMPILER="gcc --std=c++11";
	- VSPA2:
		make all ARCH_TARGET="vspa2" CPP_COMPILER="g++ --std=c++11" C_COMPILER="gcc --std=c++11".
When building the assembler on Cygwin32, "--std=gnu++11" should be used instead of "--std=c++11".
